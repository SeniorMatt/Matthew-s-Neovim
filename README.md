## Requirements
1. You need a nerd terminal font.
2. You need to have `unzip` installed.
3. Latest dotnet-sdk.

1 - Just install any nerd font from here https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads (JetBrains Mono Nerd Font for example) and make it your terminal's one so icons will work.

2 - Almost on every distro it's already installed. Otherwise, just install it with your package manager.

3 - Install the latest dotnet-sdk.

## Installation
Paste this in to your `~/.config/nvim/`.
