## Requirements
- You need to have **Omnisharp** installed inside your `~/Documents/omnisharp` folder.

You can do that by going to the official GitHub repo:
https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/releases
And downloading && extracting `omnisharp-linux-musl-x64-net6.0.tar.gz` where you need.

- You need a nerd terminal font
Just install any nerd font from here https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads 
(JetBrains Mono Nerd Font for example) and make it your terminal's one so icons will work

## Installation
Insert this in to your `~/.config/nvim/`
