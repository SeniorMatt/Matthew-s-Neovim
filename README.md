## Requirements
1. You need to have **Omnisharp** installed inside your `~/Documents/applications/omnisharp` folder.
2. You need a nerd terminal font
3. You need to have `unzip` installed.

1 - You can do that by going to the official GitHub repo:
https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/releases
And downloading && extracting `omnisharp-linux-musl-x64-net6.0.tar.gz` where you need.

2 - Just install any nerd font from here https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads (JetBrains Mono Nerd Font for example) and make it your terminal's one so icons will work

3 - Almost on every distro it's already installed. Otherwise, just install it with your package manager.

## Installation
Insert this in to your `~/.config/nvim/`
